# Grunt SVG Spriter

## Goals
The main goal of this package is to create a SVG sprite with you fancy icons and to generate easy-to-use fallback to PNG for all legacy browsers we need to support.

## WIP
Actually, this package is still in development and my mind is changing frequently upon the way we can live with svg-png technologies in icon systems.

Right now I'm working on generating png fallback for multicolour and monocolour icons in different sizes.

Stay tuned.
